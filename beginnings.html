  A bearer of news of death appears to himself as very important, 99 A highly
  embroiled quarter, a network of
  <a href="https://ubu.com/ubu/unpub/Unpub_047_Gray-Paulsen.pdf">streets</a>
  that I had avoided for years, was disentangled at a single stroke…, 69 A
  mechanical cabinet at the fair at Lucca, 86 A popular tradition warns against
  recounting dreams the next morning on an empty stomach, 45 A visit to Goethe’s
  house, 47 All religions have honored the beggar, 102 An architecture that
  follows fantasy’s first impulse, 81 Anyone intending to embark on a major work
  should be lenient with himself…, 64 Archaic statues offer in their smiles, the
  consciousness of their bodies to the onlooker…, 82 As I stepped from a house
  in a dream, the night <a href="indexsky.html">sky</a> met my eyes, 83 Behind
  someone who is loved, the abyss of sexuality closes like that of the family,
  77 Beyond doubt: a secret connection exists between the measure of goods and
  the measure of life—, 96 Booths have docked like rocking boats on both sides
  of the stone jetty on which people jostle, 83 Bourgeois existence is the
  regime of private affairs, 100 “Does not the reed the world”, 70 Each stone he
  finds, each flower he picks, and each butterfly he catches is already the
  start of a collection…, 73 Few things are more characteristic of the Nordic
  man…, 70 Fools lament the decay of criticism, 89 He already knows all the
  hiding places in the apartment…, 74 He who asks fortune-tellers the future
  unwittingly forfeits an inner intimation of coming events…, 98 He who, awake
  and dressed, perhaps while hiking, witnesses the
  <a href="indexsky.html">sun</a>rise, preserves all day before others the
  serenity of the invisibly crowned…,76 How much more easily the leave-taker is
  loved!, 53 I dreamed I was a member of an exploring party in Mexico, 51 I had
  arrived in Riga to visit a woman friend, 68 I know someone who is
  absent-minded, 69 I sat at night in a violent pain on a bench, 94 I saw in a
  dream, barren terrain, 60 I stood for ten minutes for an omnibus, 78 If a
  person very close to us is dying…, 54 If one had to expound on the teachings
  of antiquity with utmost brevity while standing on one leg…, 103 In a dream, I
  saw myself in Goethe’s study, 47 In a dream, I took my life with a gun, 91 In
  a love affair most see an eternal homeland, 75 In an aversion to animals, the
  predominant feeling is fear of being recognized by them through contact, 50 In
  everything that is with reason called beautiful, appearance has a paradoxical
  effect, 75 In summer, fat people are conspicuous; in winter, thin, 83 In the
  early morning I drove through Marseilles to the station…, 90 In the s<a

  >k of phraseology that lays bare the amalgam of stupidity and cowardice
  <a href="https://ubu.com/ubu/unpub/Unpub_047_Gray-Paulsen.pdf">Index</a> of
  Beginnings 19 constituting the mode of life of the German bourgeois…, 54 It is
  as if this château had been forgotten, 81 Just as this era is the antithesis
  of the Renaissance in general..., 61 Like someone performing the giant swing
  on the horizontal bar, each boy spins for himself the wheel of fortune…, 49
  Memory always sees the loved one smaller, 77 My expectations have been most
  disappointed, 97 Nothing is poorer than a truth expressed as it was thought,
  95 Nothing more desolating than his acolytes, 79 On the portal, the “Spes”
  [Hope] by Andrea de Pisano, 83 On the <a href="indexsky.html">sun</a>niest,
  least frequented square stands the cathedral, 81 One is with the woman he
  loves, speaks with her, 76 One thing is reserved to the greatest epic writers,
  the capacity to feed their heroes, 75 Only he who can view his own past as an
  abortion sprung from compulsion and need can use it to full advantage in every
  present, 76 Only images in the mind vitalize the will, 75 Pedantically
  brooding over the production of objects—visual aids, toys, or books— that are
  supposed to be sui<a href="grass.html">table</a> for children, 52 Place de la
  Concorde: the Obelisk, 70 Quotations in my work are like wayside robbers who
  leap out, and relieve the idle stroller of his conviction, 95 Riga, 86 Ruins
  jutting into the <a href="indexsky.html">sky</a> can appear doubly beautiful
  on clear days…, 81 Sailors seldom come ashore…, 101 Sexual fulfillment
  delivers the man from his secret…, 97 Should an obstacle prevent union, at
  once the fantasy of a <a href="grass.html">content</a>ed, shared old age is at
  hand, 77 Sir, why did you become a publisher?, 97 Snob in the private office
  of art criticism, 65 The author lays the idea on the marble
  <a href="grass.html">table</a> of the café, 88 The beauty of tall sailing
  ships is unique, 81 The blue distance which never gives way to the
  foreground…, 78 The boss’s room bristles with weapons, 90 The clock over the
  school playground seems as if damaged on his account, 72 The construction of
  life is at present in the power far more of facts than of convictions, 45 The
  critic is the strategist in the literary struggle, 66 The distinction of the
  forest of stone-pines; its roof is formed without interlacements, 82 The
  following experience will be familiar, 75 The furniture style of the second
  half of the nineteenth century has received its only adequate description, and
  analysis, in a certain type of detective novel…, 48 The gently rising, curved
  baroque staircase leading to the church..., 80 The hours that hold the figure
  and the form, 46 The incomparable language of the death’shead: total
  expressionlessness—, 70 The landscapes of shooting ranges in fairground booths
  ought to be described collectively as a corpus, 84 The mob, impelled by a
  frenetic hatred of the life of the mind..., 64 The more antagonistic a person
  is toward the traditional order, the more inexorably he will subject his
  private life to the norms that he wishes to elevate as legislators of a future
  society, 53 The notion of the class war can be misleading, 80 The only way of
  knowing a person is to love that person without hope, 77 The platform bearing
  the docile animals moves close to the ground, 73 The special sense of a town
  is formed in part for its inhabitants…, 82 The tractatus is an Arabic form, 69
  The truly loving person delights in finding the beloved, arguing, in the
  wrong, 77 The whole composition must be permeated with a protracted and wordy
  exposition of the initial plan, 63 These are days when no one should rely
  unduly on his “competence,” 49 This is the weightiest objection to the mode of
  life of the confirmed bachelor: he eats by himself, 91 Three thousand ladies
  and gentlemen from the Kurfürstendamm are to be arrested in their beds, 60
  Through the chink in the scarcely open larder door, his hand advances like a
  lover through the night, 72 To convince is to conquer without conception, 47
  To great writers, finished works weigh lighter than those fragments on which
  they work 20 throughout their lives, 47 To someone looking through piles of
  old letters, a stamp that has long been out of circulation on a torn envelope
  often says more than a reading of a dozen pages, 91 To the lover, the loved
  one appears always as solitary, 77 Two people who are in love are attached
  above all else to their names, 77 We have long forgotten the ritual by which
  the house of our life was erected, 46 What is “solved?”, 51 What makes the
  very first glimpse of a village, a town, in the landscape…, 78 What the
  Byzantine Madonna carries on her arm is only a life-size wooden doll, 82 Work
  on good prose has three steps…61 You are given a book from the school library,
