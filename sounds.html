  accompaniment of an étude, 65 alarm signal, 95; for fire, 80 background of
  insipid sounds, 65 bang, of a bulls-eye, 86 beating, of a drum, 85 booming
  orchestration, of a carousel, 73 blasting, of the imagination, 75 breathing as
  drawn, 74, 75, 100 held in while hiding, 74 of holy syllables, 75 in a child’s
  narration of a story, 72 cacophony, of voices, 65 chiming, of the
  tower-clocks, 82 clink, of the prison door, 85 clattering, of the teacher’s
  voice, 72 conversation as collegial, 76 criss-crossed with names, 101
  dominated by a man refusing to eat, 91 in snatches, 90 crumbling, of rock, 80
  cry for help, 95 induced by a film, 89 loud enough to drive out a demon, 74 of
